# SecureStats

SecureStats is a decentralized Bitcoin-backed lending protocol built on the Stacks blockchain. It enables users to obtain loans using their Bitcoin as collateral, all managed through secure smart contracts.

## Features

- **Bitcoin Collateralization**: Lock up BTC as collateral through Stacks
- **Automated Loan Management**: Smart contracts handle loan terms and liquidations
- **Dynamic Interest Rates**: Variable rates based on collateralization ratio
- **Governance System**: Protocol parameters managed by governance token holders
- **Liquidation Protection**: Multiple safety mechanisms to protect borrowers

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts

The protocol consists of the following main components:

1. **Core Lending Contract**: Manages loan creation, repayment, and liquidations
2. **Price Oracle**: Provides real-time BTC/USD price feeds
3. **Governance Contract**: Handles protocol parameter updates
4. **Treasury Contract**: Manages protocol fees and rewards

### Key Parameters

- Minimum Collateralization Ratio: 150%
- Liquidation Threshold: 130%
- Base Interest Rate: 5%
- Protocol Fee: 1%
